## Overview_Of_NLP.pdf
[This document](Overview_Of_NLP.pdf) shows my knowledge of NLP at the start of the class and what I planned on using it for in my personal and professional projects.
## Homework1
[This project](Homework1) tests my text processing skills by translating example employee information data.csv to a binary pickled dictioary stored as data.txt.
To run it, downlload python, go to your terminal, navigate to thefolder and write 'python hw1lgn190000.py [location of file to be processed, in the example case "data/dat.csv"]'
Python is good for text processing in that it has so many tools for it. However, it can be really slow compared to other programs.
What I learned from this was python file management and pickling.
