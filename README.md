 Has projects from Human Language Processing.
## Overview_Of_NLP.pdf
[This document](Overview_Of_NLP.pdf) shows my knowledge of NLP at the start of the class and what I planned on using it for in my personal and professional projects.
## Homework1
[This project](Homework1) tests my text processing skills by translating example employee information data.csv to a binary pickled dictioary stored as data.txt.
To run it, downlload python, go to your terminal, navigate to thefolder and write 'python hw1lgn190000.py [location of file to be processed, in the example case "data/dat.csv"]'
Python is good for text processing in that it has so many tools for it. However, it can be really slow compared to other programs.
What I learned from this was python file management and pickling.
## Homework2
[This project](Homework2) runs a word guessing game from the 50 most popular nouns in a given document. This project works with various features of NLTK, including tokenization, lemmaization, and POS identification. Running instructions are similar to homework one.
## Homework3
[This project](Homework3.pdf) demonstrates my knowledge of WordNet & SentiWordNet, which are libraries and databases of words, their synonyms, sentiments, etc.
## SentenceParsing
[This project](SentenceParsing.pdf) is my breakdown an analysis of different ways to parse sentences in NLPs. 
## Homework4
[This project](Homework4) demonstrates my use of bigrams in one specific use case (language detection) and an analysis of other uses as well.
## Webcrawler
[This project](Webcrawler) is a webcrawler I made that gets sixteen links from a site, goes to those links, turns the websites it is on into text, (including the origin) an prints out word frequecies of those words.
## Wuntoothry
[This project](Webcrawler) is a simple chatbot Imade for mychatbot project. It's not that impressive and somewhat incommplete due to poor mental health.
## DLDiseaseClassifier
[This project](DLDiseaseClassifier) was meant to be a demonstration of various deep learning techniques but unfortunately it's incomplete due to poor mental health.
# What did I learn?
In summary I learned how to better use python. I now feel comfortable using its libraries and fuctions in and beyond NLP. I also worked on my presentation skills by having multiple in-class presentations for my projects. Having a chatbot as a goal helped me set realistic expectations for myself and focus on what's in front of me rather than stressing about the whole ambitions project.
My skills in NLP have increased. I now know how to extract information from a text, which databases can be used to classify it, how to make my own database to classify it, and how language can be analysed overall. I plan to use knowlege from this to help improve the  rapidly growing feild of chatbots in a job one day. Maybe help make a good customer service one.
