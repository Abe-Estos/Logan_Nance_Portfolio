 Has projects from Human Language Processing.
## Overview_Of_NLP.pdf
[This document](Overview_Of_NLP.pdf) shows my knowledge of NLP at the start of the class and what I planned on using it for in my personal and professional projects.
## Homework1
[This project](Homework1) tests my text processing skills by translating example employee information data.csv to a binary pickled dictioary stored as data.txt.
To run it, downlload python, go to your terminal, navigate to thefolder and write 'python hw1lgn190000.py [location of file to be processed, in the example case "data/dat.csv"]'
Python is good for text processing in that it has so many tools for it. However, it can be really slow compared to other programs.
What I learned from this was python file management and pickling.
## Homework2
[This project](Homework2) runs a word guessing game from the 50 most popular nouns in a given document. This project works with various features of NLTK, including tokenization, lemmaization, and POS identification. Running instructions are similar to homework one.
## Homework3
[This project](Homework3.pdf) demonstrates my knowledge of WordNet & SentiWordNet, which are libraries and databases of words, their synonyms, sentiments, etc.
## SentenceParsing
[This project](SentenceParsing.pdf) is my breakdown an analysis of different ways to parse sentences in NLPs.
